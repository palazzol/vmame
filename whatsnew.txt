Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up the freekick.c driver [Sonikos]:
 - added 2nd button in gigas/gias2m/oigas
 - matched the Z80 chip mhz to the "confirmed" mhz of gigas

Extended the gfxlayout structure to support "extended" arrays of
x and y offsets. These are used for layouts that are larger than
32x32. This enables the standard structure to be smaller for the
vast majority of games that don't require huge graphics decodes.
The end result is that the MAME .exe is ~3MB smaller.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Added some Amiga enhancements needed for MESS Amiga and CDTV 
drivers. [Dirk Best]

Removed non-existant 3rd & 4th player controls from deadconx.
[Don Maeby]

Improvements to the MACS driver: [Tomasz Slanina]
 - fixed a couple of gfx bugs in st0016 video emulation
 - added hacks to allow MACS games to boot
 - removed REGION_DISPOSE flag from srmp5 and speaglsht (no more 
    crashes)

Fixed/improved DIP switches in the powerbal.c, konamigx.c, and 
gsword.c drivers. [Twisty]

More improvements to the BFM driver and the 6840 timer emulation.
[El Condor]

Improvements to the x86 drc engine and the Windows blitters:
 - Blitter CPUID features now accessed by drc_x86_get_features() call
 - Added win_blit_init(), to initialize the blitter
 - Changes to DRC to support usage for things other than CPU cores
 - Fixed drc_dasm() so it works once again
 - Added macros for a number of MMX/SSE instructions
 - Added a number of MMX/SSE instructions to the i386 disassembler

Actually applied the Marine Date fixes which were mentioned in a
previous u release. [Aaron Giles]

Added experimental support for building using Visual C++ 2003/2005.
To do this, you still need the mingw environment (ironically) because
we rely on the mingw make system to call out to the MSVC compilers.
Set the variable MSVC_BUILD=1 on the command line or by modifying
windows.mak, and it will build using the Microsoft compilers. This
works through the use of a stub program vconv.exe which translates
gcc options into MSVC options. As a bootstrapping measure, vconv.exe
is compiled at the start of a clean build by mingw. Most of the
standard build options just work (SYMBOLS, MAP, DEBUG, etc). If you
have a beefy computer, you can also set MAXOPT=1 and use link-time
code generation for maximum optimization effect. :) [Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary support for 64-bit targets. A new makefile define
PTR64 should be set if you are compiling for a 64-bit target. This
propogates a PTR64 define into the C files as well. Made the makefile
smart enough to auto-disable the drc cores for 64-bit, and removed
most of the roadblocks to a 64-bit build, apart from the assembly
blitters, which are currently undergoing a rewrite. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in the debugger that would prevent you from typing a
command line longer than what was visible. [Aaron Giles]

Added a new tool jedutil, which will convert .JED files to binary
form and back again. [Aaron Giles]

Added new ROM region REGION_PLDS, which is designed to hold binary
dumps of PLD fusemaps (produced from .JED files by jedutil). Added
logic to -romident to automatically parse .JED files to identify them
against these binary dumps. Added PLD dumps to the Vindicators,
Batman, Pit Fighter, ThunderJaws, and Relief Pitcher drivers. More to
come shortly. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed/improved DIP switches in the megasys1, dietgo, and yunsun16
drivers. [Twisty]

Fixed some DIP switches and added controls for 2nd player in cocktail 
mode in Lost Castle in Darkmist. [Sonikos]

Fixed a number of issues in the Windows rendering code:
[Giuseppe Gorgoglione]
 * fixed blit_vectors so it used the dirty pixel array in D3D mode
 * fixed blit_vectors rotation issue for dirty pixels as well
 * changed -full_screen_brightness to -full_screen_gamma
    (which is a more correct description)
 * changed -d3dfilter to be a boolean, since the other filtering modes
    are either obsolete or not applicable to MAME
 * removed limitations on windowing position so you no longer need to
    be aligned on an 8-pixel boundary
 * cleaned up a number of unused global variables
 * improved multi-monitor support to work in GDI mode as well as in
    non-full-screen modes
 * added missing documentation for the -screen parameter

Fixed some remaining errors and inconsistencies in the content and 
usage of MAME header files by comparing declarations against actual
definitions. Removed many orphaned/duplicate declarations. Added
#includes where appropriate, and moved a few declarations to another
file when they were in the wrong location. [Atari Ace]

Removed a number of unused ROM regions. Most (but not all) of the
empty ROM region warnings are now taken care of. Also uncommented/
added missing undumped ROMs/XORs in the Namco and CPS2 games.
[Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up the usage of includes/*.h files across the project, by
ensuring that:
 1. All includes/foo.h files are annotated with comments describing 
     the source of the declarations.
 2. Each source file so annotated also explicitly does an
     #include "includes/foo.h" to ensure consistent definitions.
Along the way a number of inconsistent, irrelevant, and incomplete
declarations were removed/cleaned up. [Atari Ace]

Moved calls to ui_set_visible_area() into set_visible_area() to work
around timing problems when they are called at separate times during
a single frame. [Nathan Woods]

Updated CPS driver to more accurately draw tilemaps, based on
evidence from a board with mixed ROMs. [David Haywood]

Fixed crash bug in old debugger introduced in the last release.
[Olivier Galibert]

Added demo sounds DIP switch to Pig Newton. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed DIP switches in gunmast, batlbubl. [Brian Troha]

Added simulated sound for tumbleb2 and pangpang. [David Haywood]

Added accessors for the CA2, CB2 and IRQ signals on the 6821 PIA.
[Nathan Woods]

Accurate C-Chip emulation in Bonze Adventure to fix protection 
problems (no more missing or made up data, all data extracted from 
working pcb). [Bryan McPhail]

Some cleanups to the Taito F3 naming. [Marco, Bryan McPhail]

Fixed the Z80 PIO code to prevent an interrupt to occur between the 
PIO_OP_MODE byte and mask which follows. According to the datasheet, 
this is not permitted in hardware. [Robert]

Added many FPU opcodes to the M68040 core. [Ville Linde]

Fixed rom loading in all Taito JC games. [Ville Linde]

Added TMS320C51 cpu core. [Ville Linde]

Split out some of the Nintendo 64 core pieces into MESS-shareable
modules. [R. Belmont]

Removed hard linkage of game driver clones. This reduces hard 
inter-driver dependencies and allows for easier usage of tiny.mak.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Updates to the PGM driver: [El Semi]
 - Corrected mask on sprite width parameter in sprite list
 - Corrected decryption function for The Killing Blade
 - Fixed GFX Rom loading in The Killing Blade
 - Added set The Killing Blade (Taiwan?)
 - Added some WIP protection simulation for The Killing Blade
    (Taiwan?), game boots but at least one stage is broken

Added $(OBJ)/%.s target to the makefile for easy disassembly
analysis of generated code (you can also use the $(OBJ)/%.pp to
examine preprocessor output). [Nathan Woods]

Moved region and address space names out of the Windows-specific
code and into more common locations. [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed a bug with code comments that led to incorrect display for
long comments. [Andrew Gardner]

Added several missing H8 opcodes to the core and color DAC to 
lastfght.c. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed -romident option so that it returns errorlevels based on how
many ROMs were identified (0=all files identified, 1=all files except
some non-ROM files identified, 2=some files identified, 3=no files
identified). [Aaron Giles]

Added stricter type checking for save state registrations (only works 
in gcc). [Aaron Giles]

Changed automatic ROM assignment logic in the memory system so that
it doesn't auto-assign out-of-bounds ROM regions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed memory save state registration so it doesn't register for
saving memory areas that overlap memory regions. This means that 
drivers which rely on extra memory regions for RAM will need to fix
that before supporting save. [Aaron Giles]

Modified a number of drivers that were using empty RAM regions for
RAM or which had extraneous memory regions. Most significant changes
were to the arcadia, nss, and stv drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Added a warning during validity checks to point out empty memory
regions. These should either be eliminated, or marked with an 
explicit fill value (ROMREGION_ERASE00 or ROMREGION_ERASEFF) to clear
the warnings. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote a large chunk of the Amiga emulation to support sound and
additional video modes/effects including extra half-bright mode, 
manual sprites, and mid-scanline changes. This is still a work
in progress. [Aaron Giles]
