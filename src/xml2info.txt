MAME XML to INFO converter v1.0
-------------------------------

This program is a stream filter able to translate the MAME XML
output of the -listxml to the old INFO format.

A typical use is :

	mame -listxml | xml2info > mame.lst


COMPILING
---------

To help the compiling process on all platforms a copy of the libexpat
library (version 1.95.6) is directly included in the sources.

To compile the program use the command :

	gcc -O1 -o xml2info xml2info.c


CHECKING
--------

The program does the following extra checks on the XML input :

) Any game has a name attribute.
) Any game name is unique.
) Any cloneof/romof/sampleof attribute references an existing game.

Please note that the program doesn't validate the XML input. It only
checks if it's weel-formed.
