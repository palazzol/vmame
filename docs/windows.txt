Using the program
-----------------

mame [name of the game to run] [options]

For example:

   mame robby -nosound

...will run Robby Roto without sound


Configuration options
---------------------

-createconfig / -cc

	Creates the default MAME.INI file. All the following configuration
	options can be permanently changed by editing this configuration file.

-showconfig / -sc

	Displays the current configuration settings. If you route this to a
	file, you can use it as an INI file. For example, the command:

		mame -showconfig >mame.ini

	is equivalent to -createconfig.

-showusage / -su

	Displays a summary of all the command line options. For options that
	are not mentioned here, the short summary given by "mame -showusage" is
	usually sufficient.

-[no]readconfig / -[no]rc

	Enables or disables the reading of the config files. When enabled
	(which is the default), MAME reads the following config files in order:

		- MAME.INI
		- $MY_MAME.INI (i.e. if MAME was renamed MAME060.EXE, MAME
				parses MAME060.INI here)
		- MAMED.INI  (if this is a debug build, i.e. MAMED.EXE)
		- VECTOR.INI (for vector games only)
		- DRIVER.INI (based on the source filename of the driver)
		- PARENT.INI (for clones only, may be called recursively)
		- GAMENAME.INI

	The settings in the later ini's override those in the earlier ini's.
	So, for example, if you wanted to disable hardware stretch in the
	vector games, you can create a VECTOR.INI with the "hwstretch 0" line
	in it, and it will override whatever hwstretch value you have in your
	MAME.INI.

-[no]verbose / -[no]v

	Displays some diagnostic information at startup. IMPORTANT: when
	reporting bugs, please run with mame -verbose and include the resulting
	information. It can be very helpful in tracking down problems. The
	default is off (-noverbose)

-validate / -valid

	Performs internal validation on every driver in the system. Run this
	before submitting changes to ensure that you haven't violated any of
	the core system "rules".


Windows path and directory options
----------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Please use the path, directory and file options ONLY in MAME.INI.
Otherwise, the outcome may be unpredictable and not consistent across releases.

-rompath / -rp

	You can give a path (list of directories seperated by semicolons) of
	directories to be searched for roms. The default is ROMS (that is, a
	directory "roms" in the current directory).

-samplepath / -sp

	You can give a path (list of directories seperated by semicolons) of
	directories to be searched for samples. The default is SAMPLES (that
	is, a directory "samples" in the current directory).

-inipath

	You can give a path (list of directories seperated by semicolons) of
	directories to be searched for INI-files. The default is .;ini (that
	is, search in the current directory first, and then in the directory
	"ini" in the current directory).

-cfg_directory

	After running a game, MAME stores some user changeable settings into
	cfg_directory/gamename.cfg. Additionally, on the first start of MAME a
	cfg_directory/default.cfg is created. The default is CFG.

-nvram_directory

	The original hardware of some games use non-volative ram chips to save
	their configuration. The contents of these are saved into this
	directory. The default is NVRAM.

-memcard_directory

	The original hardware of some games supports so-called memory cards.
	The contents of these are stored here. The default is MEMCARD.

-input_directory

	Input recordings created by "-record" will be saved here and loaded by
	"-playback". The default is INP.

-hiscore_directory

	If there exists a file HISCORE.DAT in the MAME directory, highscores
	may also be saved for games that do not have the original hardware to
	support this. The quality of this feature depends on the accuracy of
	the externally available file HISCORE.DAT. The default is HI.

-state_directory

	MAME supports state saving for some games. These states will be saved
	here. The default is STATE.

-artwork_directory

	Some games used extra artwork not created by electical circuits. MAME
	supports such artwork in PNG image format, located in this directory.
	The default is ARTWORK.

-snapshot_directory

	Screenshots will go here. The default is SNAP.

-diff_directory

	Directory for hard drive image difference files. The default is DIFF.

-ctrlr_directory

	This directory holds controller-specific input port mapping .ini files.
	The default is CTRLR.

-cheat_file

	The default is CHEAT.DAT. Modifying the default may not work at the
	moment.


Windows video options
---------------------

-[no]autoframeskip / -[no]afs

	Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the
	game, adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the game
	running at full speed. Turning this on overrides the value you have set
	for -frameskip above. The default is ON (-autoframeskip).

-frameskip / -fs

	Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of frames out of
	every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you say -frameskip 2,
	then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By skipping those
	frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that requires more
	horsepower than your computer has. The default value is -frameskip 0,
	which skips no frames.

-[no]waitvsync

	Waits for the refresh period on your computer's monitor to finish
	before starting to draw video to your screen. If this option is off,
	MAME will just draw to the screen at any old time, even in the middle
	of a refresh cycle. This can cause "tearing" artifacts, where the top
	portion of the screen is out of sync with the bottom portion. Tearing
	is not noticeable on all games, and some people hate it more than
	others. However, if you turn this option on, you will waste more of
	your CPU cycles waiting for the proper time to draw, so you will see a
	performance hit. You should only need to turn this on in windowed mode.
	In full screen mode, it is only needed if -triplebuffer does not
	remove the tearing.  In which case you should use -notb -waitvsync.
	The default is OFF (-nowaitvsync). This option requires -ddraw.

-[no]triplebuffer / -[no]tb

	Enables or disables "triple buffering". Normally, MAME just draws
	directly to the screen, without any fancy buffering. But with this
	option enabled, MAME creates three buffers to draw to, and cycles
	between them in order. It attempts to keep things flowing such that one
	buffer is currently displayed, the second buffer is waiting to be
	displayed, and the third buffer is being drawn to. Unfortunately, due
	to some DirectDraw issues, this doesn't always work out as well as it
	should. This is still being investigated. -triplebuffer will override
	-waitvsync, if the buffer is sucessfully created. The default is OFF.
	(-notriplebuffer). This option requires -ddraw and -nowindow.

-[no]window

	Run MAME in either a window or full screen. The default is OFF
	(-nowindow).

-[no]ddraw / -[no]dd

	This is really just for testing. It disables the use of DirectDraw,
	which removes a lot of the features of the video system (-triplebuffer,
	-waitvsync, -resolution, -refresh, -switchres, -switchbpp, -resolution,
	-hwstretch all won't work). It will generally run really slowly. If
	anyone has a legitimate use for this option, we'd be curious to know.
	The default is ON (-ddraw).

-[no]direct3d / -[no]d3d

	Use Direct3D to display the image. This does not render 3D games using
	3D hardware, it just uses 3D hardware to display the image, and apply
	effects to it. -triplebuffer, -waitvsync, -resolution, -refresh,
	-switchres, -switchbpp, -resolution all work with this option. This
	option overrides -ddraw and implies -hwstretch. The default is OFF
	(-nodirect3d).

-[no]hwstretch / -[no]hws

	MAME uses the hardware stretching abilities of modern graphic cards to
	scale the game image to the requested resolution. Depending on the
	quality of your graphic card and its drivers, this may be a fractional,
	antialiased scaling (nice) or an integer, blocky scaling (not so nice).
	In any case, you can disable this stretching altogether and let MAME do
	the scaling in software, which is probably slower, though. The default
	is ON (-hwstretch). Note: Vector games may actually look better with
	"-nohws".

-screen [n]

	Specify which screen to use. The screen name is usually something like
	\\.\DISPLAYn, where \\.\DISPLAY1 is the primary screen. If no screen is
	specified the primary is used. To make additional screens available to
	MAME, as well as to any other application, they should be enabled at
	first: from "Control Panel -> Display -> Settings", select the desired
	screen icon and check "Extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor".
	To get the full list of available screens start MAME with -verbose.

-cleanstretch [option] / -cs [option]

	Stretch the image to integer ratios only. This may leave a black border
	around the image in fullscreen mode. The options are:

		none	    disable. This will cause artifacts when using
			    scanlines.
		auto	    let the blitter decide. The d3d module will select
			    the best option.
		full	    always stretch to integer ratios both horizontally
			    and vertically.
		horizontal  always stretch to integer ratios horizontally.
		vertical    always stretch to integer ratios vertically.

	The default is AUTO (-cleanstretch auto). This option requires -ddraw
	or -direct3d.

-resolution wxh[xd] / -r wxh[xd]

	Specifies an exact resolution to run in. In full screen mode, MAME will
	try to use the specific resolution you request. The width (w) and
	height (h) are required; the color depth (d) is optional. If omitted or
	set to 0, MAME will determine the mode auomatically. For example,
	-resolution 640x480 will force 640x480 resolution, but MAME is free to
	choose the color depth. Similarly, -resolution 0x0x32 will force 32-bit
	color depth, but allows MAME to choose the resolution. The string
	"auto" is also supported, and is equivalent to 0x0x0. In window mode,
	this resolution is used as a maximum size for the window. The default
	is auto (-resolution auto). This option requires -ddraw for full screen
	resolution switching.

-refresh

	Specifies a particular refresh rate to set your monitor to. If the
	refresh rate is not found, or if this parameter is 0, the default
	DirectDraw refresh rate is used. The default is -refresh 0. This option
	requires -ddraw and -nowindow.

-[no]scanlines / -[no]sl

	Enables the classic MAME "scanlines" effect. The default is OFF
	(-noscanlines). This option requires -nohwstretch.

-[no]switchres

	Enables resolution switching. This option is required for the
	-resolution option to switch resolutions in full screen mode. On many
	modern video cards with hardware stretching support, there is little
	performance penalty at higher resolutions, so it is nice to be able to
	get rid of the monitor resync time when you run in full screen mode.
	This is also useful on LCD displays with a fixed resolution. The
	default is ON (-switchres). This option requires -ddraw.

-[no]switchbpp

	Enables color depth switching. This option is required for the
	-resolution option to switch color depths in full screen mode. This
	option is useful if you normally run at 16, 24, or 32 bit color depth
	on your desktop, and want to keep that color depth when you run MAME.
	The default is ON (-switchbpp). This option requires -ddraw.

-[no]maximize / -[no]max

	Controls initial window size in windowed mode. If it is set on, the
	window will initially stretch to the maximum supported size when you
	start MAME. If it is turned off, the window will start out at the
	smallest supported size. The default is ON (-maximize). This option
	requires -window.

-[no]keepaspect / -[no]ka

	Enables aspect ratio enforcement. When this option is on, the game's
	proper aspect ratio (generally 4:3 or 3:4) is enforced, so you get the
	game looking like it should. When running in a window with this option
	on, you can only resize the window to the proper aspect ratio, unless
	you are holding down the CONTROL key. By turning the option off, the
	aspect ratio is allowed to float. In full screen mode, this means that
	all games will stretch to the full screen size (even vertical games).
	In window mode, it means that you can freely resize the window without
	any constraints. The default is ON (-keepaspect).

-[no]matchrefresh

	Enables refresh rate matching. When enabled, MAME will try to find the
	closest refresh rate match that is greater than the game's refresh
	rate. For example, if the game runs at 57fps, and you have 60, 70, 75Hz
	refresh rates, MAME will choose 60Hz. If the game runs at 61fps, then
	it will choose 70Hz. This is intended mainly for those who have tweaked
	their video card's settings to provide carefully matched refresh rate
	options. The default is OFF (-nomatchrefresh). This option requires
	-ddraw and -nowindow.

-[no]syncrefresh

	Enables speed throttling only to the refresh of your monitor. This
	means that the game's actual refresh rate is ignored; however, the
	sound code still attempts to keep up with the game's original refresh
	rate, so you may encounter sound problems. Again, this is intended
	mainly for those who have tweaked their video card's settings to
	provide carefully matched refresh rate options. The default is OFF
	(-nosyncrefresh). This option requires -ddraw.

-[no]throttle

	Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on, MAME
	attempts to keep the game running at the game's intended speed. When
	throttling is off, MAME runs the game as fast as it can. The default is
	ON (-throttle).

-full_screen_gamma / -fsg

	Some video cards adjust the gamma when they switch into full screen
	mode. To counteract this, you can specify the -full_screen_gamma value,
	which is a number between 0.1 and 4. 0.1 means 1/10th as bright as the
	default, and 4 means four times as bright.
	Note that the hardware support for this option is not present on all
	video cards. You may get a warning if MAME was unable to set the gamma
	on your card. The default is 1.0, which means that MAME will not attempt
	to adjust the gamma on your video card at all. This option requires
	-ddraw and -nowindow.

-frames_to_run / -ftr

	This option can be used for benchmarking. It tells MAME to stop
	execution after a fixed number of frames. By combining this with a
	fixed set of other command line options, you can set up a consistent
	environment for benchmarking MAME performance.

-effect

	Apply various blitting effects to emulate the look of Arcade monitors.
	Using these modes comes at the cost of reduced emulation speed, which
	is inherent to these modes. The current implementation is already as
	fast as possible, using self-modifying assembly code. For some of
	these, MMX is required. Possible values:

		none	    no effect (this is the default)
		sharp	    no effect, but gives a sharper image
		scan25	    25% scanlines
		scan50	    50% scanlines
		scan75	    75% scanlines
		scan75v     75% scanlines (vertical)
		rgb3	    a certain "monitor mask"
		rgb4	    another one
		rgb4v	    another one (vertical)
		rgb6	    another one
		rgb16	    another one
		rgbtiny     another one. Choose the one you like best.

-screen_aspect

	Give a screen aspect ration in the form X:Y where X is the horizontal
	and Y the vertical part. Examples are 4:3 for most resolution settings
	on computer monitors, 5:4 for the 1280x1024 resolution or 3:4 for
	turnable LCD's in the turned position. The default is 4:3.

-mngwrite <filename>

	Writes each video frame to a MNG file, producing an animation of the
	game.


Windows video options (Direct3D)
--------------------------------

-zoom [z] / -z [z]

	Try to get a resolution that enlarges the emulated game z times. The
	default is -zoom 2. MAME determines the resolution automatically. This
	option only works with -direct3d.

-[no]d3dtexmanage

	Let Direct3D handle conversion of the image to a texture (required to
	display it with Direct3D). This is more compatible, but can be
	(significantly) slower on some hardware. The default is ON
	(-d3dtexmanage). Using -nod3dtexmanage can eliminate a loss of
	performance that may occur with some graphics cards when using
	-direct3d. This option requires -direct3d.

-[no]d3dfilter / -[no]flt

	Enable bilinear filtering when stretching the image. When disabled
	point filtering is applied. The default is -d3dfilter. This option
	requires -direct3d.

-d3dfeedback [i]

	Select the feedback effect intensity in percentages. 0 is disable,
	higher values feed back the previous frame to the current one at the
	specified intensity. The default is DISABLE (-d3dfeedback 0). This
	option requires -direct3d.

-d3dscan [i]

	Select the scanline effect intensity in percentages. 0 is black lines
	between scanlines, 100 is disable scanline effect. The default is
	DISABLE (-d3dscan 100). This option requires -direct3d.

-[no]d3deffectrotate

	Apply rotatation so that any effects are rotated along with the game
	image. The default is ON. This option requires -direct3d.

-d3dprescale [option]

	Pre-scale up the image with point filtering before fitting the image to
	the screen. This gives an only slightly fuzzy image even at high
	display resolutions. The options are:

		none	    disable.
		auto	    adaptively apply a moderate pre-scale effect,
			    depending on other efects used.
		full	    adaptively apply an agressive pre-scale effect.
		n	    (where 2 <= n <= 4) pre-scale the image n times.

	The default is AUTO (-d3dprescale auto). This option requires
	-direct3d.

-d3deffect [preset]

	Select an effect preset. Valid presets are:

		none		no effect (this is the default)
		sharp		no effect, but gives a sharper image
		scan25		25% scanlines
		scan50		50% scanlines
		scan75		75% scanlines
		scan75v 	75% scanlines (vertical)
		rgbmicro	a certain "monitor mask"
		rgbtiny 	another one
		rgb3		another one
		rgb4		another one
		rgb4v		another one (vertical)
		rgb6		another one
		rgb16		another one
		rgbminmask	another one
		dotmedmask	another one
		rgbmedmask	another one
		dotmedbright	another one (extra bright)
		rgbmaxbright	another one (extra bright)
		aperturegrille	another one. Choose the one you like best.
		auto		adaptively selects a special preset based on
				zoom level.

	The default is none (-d3deffect none). This option requires -direct3d.

-d3dcustom [custom preset]

	Supply a custom preset. The format is <-d3dcustom
	1,0,0x0100,0xC0,0,0,0,0x22,-1,8x8_mame_rgbtiny.rgb>. The meaning
	of the mumbers is:

		1	    RGB effects mode: 0 is off, 1 is multiply mode, 2
			    is add and multiply mode.
		2,3,4,5     pattern preprocessing; use mask, white level, black
			    level, desaturation, respectively.
		6	    image attenuation
		7	    feedback (0 is don't use)
		8	    prescale. bit 4: prescale horizontally, bit 0:
			    prescale vertically.
		9	    maximum scanline intensity.
		10	    pattern filename, including path.

	The filename must start with XxY, where X and Y are the dimensions of
	the pattern in pixels. Each pixel is represented by 4 bytes, red,
	green, blue, and mask, respectively. mask is an on/off value, where 0
	is off. This option requires -direct3d.

-d3dexpert [settings]

	Undocumented settings intended mostly for developers. This option
	requires -direct3d.


Windows misc options
--------------------

-[no]sleep

	Since MAME is running in a multitasking environment, it should be nice
	to its fellow processes. Therefore, if MAME does not need all
	processing power to emulate a game, it gives back already granted
	processor time to the operating system. This may not work in every
	case, so it can be disabled and MAME turned once again into a CPU hog.
	The default is ON (-sleep).

-[no]rdtsc

	Prefer RDTSC over QueryPerformanceCounter for timing. The default is
	OFF (-nordtsc). -rdtsc sometimes causes problems on laptops, and
	-nordtsc may cause problems on desktop computers. If MAME does not
	operate smoothly (and you are sure you have enough CPU power for
	the emulation), try toggling this.

-priority <priority>

	Sets the thread priority for the main MAME thread. Default is 0, which
	is NORMAL priority, guaranteeing proper cooperation with other apps. The
	valid range is -15 to 1, with 1 being the highest priority.


Windows sound options
---------------------

-audio_latency

	This controls the amount of latency built into the audio streaming. By
	default MAME tries to keep the DirectSound audio buffer between 1/5 and
	2/5 full. On some systems, this is pushing it too close to the edge,
	and you get poor sound sometimes. The latency parameter controls the
	lower threshold. The default is 1 (meaning lower=1/5 and upper=2/5).
	Set it to 2 (-audio_latency 2) to keep the sound buffer between 2/5 and
	3/5 full. If you crank it up to 4, you can definitely notice the lag.

-wavwrite <filename>

	Writes the final mixer output to the given <filename> in .WAV format.


Input device options
--------------------

-[no]mouse

	Controls whether or not MAME looks for a mouse controller to use. When
	this is enabled, you will not be able to use your mouse in Windows
	while playing a game. If you want to get control of your computer back,
	you will need to pause the game, or quit. The default is OFF
	(-nomouse).

	WinXP: -mouse is also used to enable lightguns.  This allows for multiple
	independently tracking lightguns.

-[no]joystick / -[no]joy

	Controls whether or not MAME looks for joystick/gamepad controllers.
	When this is enabled, MAME will ask DirectInput about which controllers
	are connected. The default is OFF (-nojoystick).

-[no]lightgun/ -[no]gun

	Controls whether or not MAME treats mouse inputs as lightgun inputs.
	Note that most lightguns map to the mouse, so using -lightgun and
	-mouse together may produce strange results. The default is OFF
	(-nolightgun).

	WinXP: -lightgun is ignored.  Use -mouse instead.

-[no]dual_lightgun / -[no]dual

	Controls whether or not MAME attempts to track two lightguns connected
	at the same time. This option requires -lightgun. The default is OFF
	(-nodual_lightgun).

	WinXP: -dual_lightgun is ignored.  Using -mouse will enable 2 or more
	lightguns.

-[no]offscreen_reload / -[no]reload

	Controls whether or not MAME treats a second button input from a
	lightgun as a reload signal. In this case, MAME will report the gun's
	position as (0,0) with the trigger held, which is equivalent to an
	offscreen reload. This is not needed for all lightgun games. Only
	games that required you to shoot off screen need this.  And then only
	if your gun does not support off screen reloads.
	The default is OFF (-nooffscreen_reload).

	WinXP: -offscreen_reload is valid to use.

-[no]steadykey / -[no]steady

	Some games require two or more buttons to be pressed at exactly the
	same time to make special moves. Due to limitations in the PC keyboard
	hardware, it can be difficult or even impossible to accomplish that
	using the standard keyboard handling. This option selects a different
	handling that makes it easier to register simultaneous button presses,
	but has the disadvantage of making controls less responsive. The
	default is OFF (-nosteadykey)

-[no]keyboard_leds / -[no]leds

	Since MAME uses an input device (keyboard) for output, this sort of
	belongs here. Using this option enables/disables simulation of the game
	LEDs by the keyboard LEDs. This works fine, but can lead to problems
	after exiting MAME (i.e. CAPS LOCK remains ON), so you can disable it
	here. The default is ON (-keyboard_leds).

-led_mode <ps/2|usb>

	For Windows NT and later systems, determines how LEDs on the keyboard
	are controlled. In PS/2 mode, MAME uses the low-level keyboard driver
	directly to control the LEDs. In USB mode, MAME attempts to post fake
	keypresses on the Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, and Num Lock keys in order to
	induce the LEDs to change. If you have a PS/2 keyboard, PS/2 mode is the
	more reliable approach. Default is PS/2.

-a2d_deadzone / -a2d

	If you play with an analog joystick, but the game requires digital
	input, MAME needs to convert the signals. Here you can give the ratio
	of movement along an axis that accounts for a digital signal. This
	option expects a float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. The default is 0.3.
	Note: the current handling is not precise, as it does also implicitely
	set the size of the arc which is interpreted as diagonal movement. This
	is a known problem but it requires some major rework of the input
	handling code to fix it.

-ctrlr <controller>

	Enables support for special controllers. Configuration files are
	provided for:

		hotrod	    HotRod
		hotrodse    HotRod SE
		slikstik    SlikStik
		xarcade     X-Arcade

-paddle_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun> / -paddle
-adstick_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun> / -adstick
-pedal_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun> / -pedal
-dial_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun> / -dial
-trackball_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun> / -trackball
-lightgun_device <keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun>

	Each of these options controls autoenabling the mouse, joystick, or
	lightgun depending on the presence of a particular class of analog
	control for a particular game. For example, if you specify the option
	-paddle mouse, then any game that has a paddle control will automatically
	enable mouse controls just as if you had explicitly specified -mouse.
	Note that these controls override the values of -[no]mouse, -[no]joystick,
	etc.

-digital <all|none|j<N>[a<M>[a<K>...]][,j<X>[a<Y>...]][,...]>

	Controls which joystick axes are considered digital. If MAME knows that
	a given joystick axis is digital, it can make much better decisions about
	how to treat that axis. If you are using a digital gamepad with MAME, 
	you will want to use this option. There are a number of ways to do this:

	-digital all means that all axes of all connected joysticks will be 
		treated as digital.

	-digital none means that all axes of all connected joysticks will be 
		treated as analog (this is the default behavior).
    
	-digital j2 will treat all axes of joystick #2 as digital; axes on all 
		other joysticks will be treated as analog.

	-digital j1a0a1 will treat axis 0 and 1 on joystick #1 as digital; all 
		other axes will be treated as analog.

	-digital j1a0a1,j2a5 will treat axis 0 and 1 on joystick #1 as digital, 
		as well as axis 5 on joystick #2; all other axes will be treated 
		as analog.

	Make use of the information provided by -verbose to determine which 
	joysticks and axes you should be configuring this way.


MAME core video options
-----------------------

-[no]norotate
-[no]ror
-[no]rol
-[no]autoror
-[no]autorol
-[no]flipx
-[no]flipy

	These are the standard MAME rotation options. They are all OFF by
	default.

-gamma

	This controls the global gamma correction in the game. It is the same
	gamma that is applied when you bring up the on-screen-display within
	MAME. The default is 1.0.

-brightness / -bright

	This controls the global brightness correction in the game. It is the
	same brightness that is applied when you bring up the on-screen-display
	within MAME. The default is 1.0.

-pause_brightness

	This controls the brightness level when MAME is paused. The default
	value is 0.65.


MAME core vector options
------------------------

-[no]antialias / -[no]aa

	Antialiasing for vector games. The default is ON (-antialias).

-[no]translucency / -[no]tl

	Enables or disables vector translucency. Colors of crossing vector
	beams will be merged. The default is ON (-translucency).

-beam

	Sets the width in pixels of the vectors. This option expects a float in
	the range of 1.00 through 16.00 as argument. The default is 1 (1 pixel
	wide).

-flicker

	Makes the vectors flicker. This option requires a float argument in the
	range of 0.00 - 100.00 (0=none, 100=maximum). The default is 0.

-intensity

	Sets the intensity correction for the beam. Higher values give a
	brighter beam. This option expects a float in the range of 0.5 through
	3.0 as argument.  The default is 1.5.


MAME core sound options
-----------------------

-samplerate / -sr

	Sets the audio sample rate. Smaller values (e.g. 11025) cause lower
	audio quality but faster emulation speed. Higher values (e.g. 44100)
	cause higher audio quality but slower emulation speed. The default is
	44100.

-[no]samples

	Use samples if available. The default is ON (-samples).

-[no]sound

	Enable or disable sound altogether. The default is ON (-sound).

-volume / -vol

	Sets the startup volume. It can later be changed with the On Screen
	Display (see Keys section). The volume is an attenuation in dB: e.g.,
	"-volume -12" will start with -12dB attenuation. The default is 0.


MAME core misc options
----------------------

-[no]artwork / -[no]art

	Enable or disable usage of additional artwork (backdrops, overlays,
	etc.). The default is ON (-artwork).

-[no]use_backdrops / -[no]backdrop

	Enables/disables the display of backdrops. The default is ON
	(-use_backdrops).

-[no]use_overlays / -[no]overlay

	Enables/disables the display of overlays. The default is ON
	(-use_overlays).

-[no]use_bezels / -[no]bezel

	Enables/disables the display of bezels. The default is ON
	(-use_bezels).

-[no]artwork_crop / -[no]artcrop

	This will crop the artwork to the game screen area only. The default is
	OFF (-noartwork_crop).

-artwork_resolution / -artres

	Scale the game by this factor to accommodate for higher resolution
	artwork. The default is 0 (auto).

-[no]cheat / -[no]c

	Cheats, like the speedup in Pac Man or the level-skip in many other
	games, are disabled by default. Use this switch to turn them on. The
	default is OFF (-nocheat).

-[no]debug

	Activates the integrated debugger.  During emulation, press the tilde
	key (~) to activate the debugger. This is available only if the program
	is compiled with MAME_DEBUG defined. The default is OFF (-nodebug).

-playback / -pb

	Expects a filename as parameter. Play back all game inputs from from
	file INP/filename.inp. The gamename is contained in this file,
	therefore a gamename needs not be given on the commandline.

-record / -rec

	Expects a filename as parameter. All game inputs are written to the
	file INP/filename.inp.

-[no]log

	Creates a log of illegal memory accesses in ERROR.LOG. The default is
	OFF (-nolog).

-[no]oslog

	Outputs error.log data to the Windows debugger instead of to a file.
	Default is OFF (-nooslog).

-[no]skip_gameinfo

	Forces MAME to skip displaying the game info screen. The default is OFF
	(-noskip_gameinfo).

-bios

	Expects a BIOS name as the parameter. -listxml will list the possible
	BIOS names for a game/system.

-state <slot>

	Starts MAME and loads a saved state immediately from the specified slot.


Other MAME frontend options
----------------------------

Note: By default, all the '-list' commands below write info to the screen. If
you wish to write the info to a textfile instead, add this to the end of your
command:

  > filename

...where 'filename' is the textfile's path and name (e.g., c:\mame\list.txt).

-help / -?

	Displays current MAME version and copyright notice

-listxml / -lx

	List comprehensive details for all of the supported games. The output
	is quite long, so better redirect this into a file. The output is in
	XML format.

-listfull / -ll

	Displays a list of game directory names + descriptions.

-listsource / -ls

	Displays the source file (in the drivers directory) containing the
	driver for the specified game. Useful for finding which driver a game
	runs on in order to fix bugs.

-listclones / -lc

	Lists clones of the specified game. When no game is specified, this
	generates a list of all MAME-supported clones.

-listcrc

	List CRC32 checksums of rom files

-listroms

	Displays ROMs required by the specified game.

-listsamples

	Displays samples required by the specified game.

-verifyroms

	Checks specified game(s) for missing and invalid ROMs.	Adding "*"
	checks all available games.

-verifysamples

	Check selected game for missing samples. Adding "*" checks all
	available samples.

-romident

	Attempts to identify ROM files, if they are known to MAME, in the
	specified .zip file. Can be used to try and identify ROM sets taken
	from unknown boards. On exit, the errorlevel is returned as one of
	the following:
	
		0: means all files were identified
		1: means all files were identified except for 1 or more "non-ROM"
			files
		2: means some files were identified
		3: means no files were identified

-isknown

	Very terse romident. The errorlevel is set the same as for -romident.
